// So basically this whole story revolves around one thing which is Trait is going to be a list of methods
// and if your type has those methods
// then you can use that trait for that type, But that type needs ti implement those methods

// now where to check if the type has those methods or not if custom then you know othervise
// look for docs or rust compiler will let you know baby.

// one more thing which is do we need to implement all the traits and answer is I don't know
// if there are default methods then leave it as it is othervise compiler will let you know once again.

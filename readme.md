`cargo check > try / expect / finally`

ðŸ¦€ just pushing my daily rust learnings here.

i break things, experiment, curse the borrow checker, and eventually make it work.

this is just a rusty code backup.
because when the compiler screams, i scream back.

a repo where i throw:

- stuff iâ€™m trying to learn
- stuff i broke
- stuff that accidentally worked
